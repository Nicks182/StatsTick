# StatsTick
I wanted a small app that would show CPU and GPU usage along with temps much like Task Manager, but with dark mode and an easier way to see what process was using the most CPU time.

This is by no means the be all and end all of UI design. I just needed something I could glance at and get an idea of what is going on at that moment in time. The most useful part is being able to see the top 5 processes that's eating up the most CPU time. You can click on the little 'list of 5 buttons' to get a full list of processes and their usage for that moment in time.

If I experience a lag spike or stutter, I want to be able to see which processes may have been causing it. Sorting processes by CPU usage in task manager is not useful for quick and/or unexpected spikes as the offending process will have shifted back down the list by the time you can look at it. This app will keep a short history on the screen showing the spike on the graph and the offending processes right under the spike in the graph.

For the image below I used CPU Burner (part of furmark app) to show the graph and process list doing its thing.
